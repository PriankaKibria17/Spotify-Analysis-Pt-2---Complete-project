# Spotify_Analysis

In this project I am using the "Top 200 Weekly Global Charts On Spotify" from Kaggle which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sashankpillai/spotify-top-200-charts-20202021/code. 
This particular dataset contains the top 200 songs that have been played most frequently based on several attributes. However, for this particular 
exploratory analysis I will only be analying the top 10. In order to explore this data I had to clean the data utilizing functions to drop columns, 
remove unique values, correct data types, as well as dropping null values. Afterwards, I assess the data using graphs to find correlations as well as 
the significance certain attribute may have as contributing factors for a song being considered a top 10 streaming song. All of which aided in discovering 
which attribites compose opitmal results in streams.
